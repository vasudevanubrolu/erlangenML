I am Vasudev Anubrolu, a 2020 grad in Biological Sciences and Computer Science from BITS Pilani, Pilani Campus. I am a full stack (react, graphql, golang, postgress, dgraph, mongo) engineer building software products at Deloitte Hyderabad. I am working on interesting problems on knowledge graphs, graph databases and DevSecOps. Primarily work in JS, golang and python. I love ML and like to build algorithms that work at scale.
